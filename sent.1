.PP
\&...is a simple plaintext presentation tool.
.PP
\f[C]sent\f[R] does not need \f[C]latex\f[R], \f[C]libreoffice\f[R] or
any other fancy file format, it uses plaintext files to describe the
slides and can include images via \f[C]farbfeld\f[R].
Every paragraph represents a slide in the presentation.
.PP
The presentation is displayed in a simple X11 window.
The content of each slide is automatically scaled to fit the window and
centered so you also don\[cq]t have to worry about alignment.
Instead you can really concentrate on the content.

\f[C]
    make && ./sent example
\f[R]
.fi
.PP

.SH Usage
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sent [-hv] [-fn font]
     [-uw height] [-uh xoffset] [-ls xoffset]
     [-fg color] [-bg color]
     FILE
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If FILE is omitted or equals \f[C]-\f[R], stdin will be read.
Produce image slides by prepending a \f[C]\[at]\f[R] in front of the
filename as a single paragraph.
Lines starting with \f[C]#\f[R] will be ignored.
A \f[C]\[rs]\f[R] at the beginning of the line escapes \f[C]\[at]\f[R]
and \f[C]#\f[R].
A presentation file could look like this:
.IP
.nf
